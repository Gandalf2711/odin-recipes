    <p>A classic French stew from the Burgundy region, featuring chicken braised in red wine with mushrooms and crispy pancetta.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3pounds chicken legs and thighs</li>
        <li>2½teaspoons kosher salt, more as needed</li>
        <li>½teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, more to taste</li>
        <li>3cups hearty red wine, preferably from Burgundy</li>
        <li>1bay leaf</li>
        <li>1teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves</li>
        <li>4ounces lardons, pancetta or bacon, diced into ¼-inch pieces (about 1 cup)</li>
        <li>3tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, more as needed</li>
        <li>1large onion, diced</li>
        <li>1large carrot, peeled and diced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol">
        <li>Season chicken with 2¼ teaspoons salt and ½ teaspoon pepper. In a large bowl, combine chicken, wine, bay leaf and thyme. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or, even better, overnight.</li>
        <li>In a large Dutch oven or a heavy-bottomed pot with a tightfitting lid, cook lardons over medium-low heat until fat has rendered, and lardons are golden and crisp, 10 to 15 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer lardons to a paper-towel-lined plate, leaving rendered fat in pot.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from wine, reserving the marinade. Pat chicken pieces with paper towels until very dry. Heat lardon fat over medium heat until it’s just about to smoke. Working in batches if necessary, add chicken in a single layer and cook until well browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side. (Add oil if the pot looks a little dry.) Transfer chicken to a plate as it browns.</li>
        <li>Add diced onion, carrot, half the mushrooms and the remaining ¼ teaspoon salt to pot. Cook until vegetables are lightly browned, about 8 minutes, stirring up any brown bits from the pot, and adjusting heat if necessary to prevent burning.</li>
        <li>Stir in garlic and tomato paste and cook for 1 minute, then stir in flour and cook for another minute. Remove from heat, push vegetables to one side of pot, pour brandy into empty side, and ignite with a match. (If you’re too nervous to ignite it, just cook brandy down for 1 minute.) Once the flame dies down, add reserved marinade, bring to a boil, and reduce halfway (to 1½ cups), about 12 minutes. Skim off any large pockets of foam that form on the surface.</li>
